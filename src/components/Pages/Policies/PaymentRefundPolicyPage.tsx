                        You are required to select a payment method while placing an order. Mode of payment can be online credit/debit or cash on delivery. Some of our partner restaurants offer all of the above or some may restrict their payment to any of the above-listed payment options. The debit and credit card payments are transferred using the secured payment gateway services. While using the debit/credit card you can save your information on your device and every time you place an order you can use the same credentials to complete your order. This information can be saved at your own risk and we will not be liable for any claims or whatsoever due to any fraud that may arise for the same. If you want to disable your saved data you can remove from the same from your profile settings.
