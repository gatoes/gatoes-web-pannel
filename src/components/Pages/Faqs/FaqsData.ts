      question: "Is ordering through Gatoes safe?",
      answer: "Our absolute priority is to offer the safest service possible to customers, riders and restaurants and we have taken a number of important actions to ensure we deliver food safely for everyone. For example, we have introduced contact-free delivery, guidelines for restaurants on how to run delivery-only kitchens hygienically and guidance for riders on safe and secure delivery. We are in daily contact with local health officials to make sure we are offering customers, restaurants and riders the most up-to-date guidance and safest service possible."

      question: "How does contact-free delivery work?",
      answer: "Customers can choose ‘Contact-free delivery’ at check-out. Riders will be able to see when a customer has selected this option in the order’s delivery notes and will then follow a simple process to ensure there is no contact when the food is delivered. Riders will be asked to let the customer know they have arrived, place the order outside their door, step a safe distance back and wait nearby for the customer to collect the food before the order can be completed. Riders are also able to make orders contact-less if they wish by letting customers know through the app before they arrive."

      question: "Are all the same restaurants available as usual?",
      answer: "The Government has announced that all restaurants and cafes must shut to dine in customers, but delivery can remain open. If a restaurant would like to keep their kitchens open to delivery customers, they can still do so via Gatoes but this is the choice of the restaurant."
